  "prompt": "The \"Bell\" in the top right corner is not available, also not when the \"Alert Notification\" extension is installed.",
  "expected_answer": "Make sure that notifications are enabled in your wiki. You can enable them by setting the `notifications.enabled` setting in `xwiki.properties` to `true`.",
  "ai_answer": "https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/ \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/XWikiSyntax/ \n\n\nIt seems like you are referring to the \"Alert Notification\" feature in XWiki, which should display a bell icon in the top bar to show notifications. Here are a few troubleshooting steps you can follow to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Verify Extension Installation**:\n   Ensure that the \"Alerts Application\" and \"Notifications Application\" are correctly installed. You can check this in the Extension Manager.\n\n2. **Check User Permissions**:\n   Make sure that the user has the necessary permissions to view notifications. Sometimes, the visibility of certain UI elements can be restricted based on user roles and permissions.\n\n3. **Clear Cache**:\n   Clear your browser cache and reload the page. Sometimes, changes do not reflect immediately due to cached data.\n\n4. **Check Configuration**:\n   Go to the user profile settings and ensure that notifications are enabled. Users can customize their notification preferences, and it might be turned off.\n\n5. **Look for Errors**:\n   Check the browser console for any JavaScript errors that might be preventing the bell icon from displaying. Also, check the XWiki logs for any errors related to the notifications.\n\n6. **Theme and Customization**:\n   If you have a custom theme or skin applied, it might be hiding the bell icon. Try switching to the default theme to see if the icon appears.\n\nIf you have verified all the above and the issue persists, you might want to consult the [XWiki Documentation](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/XWikiSyntax/) or reach out to the XWiki community for further assistance.",
