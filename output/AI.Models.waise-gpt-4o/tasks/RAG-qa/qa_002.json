  "expected_answer": "Make sure that notifications are enabled. You can enable them by setting the `notifications.enabled` setting in `xwiki.properties` to `true`. Further, ensure that you're subscribed to the pages or users you want to receive notifications for. You can watch a page, a page and its children, or an entire wiki. To watch a location, all you need is to go to that place, and then click on the \"alert\" menu (represented by a bell) and enable the desired notifications. To follow a user, if you go to the profile of an user, using the User Index for example, you can see decide to watching a user. It means you will receive all notifications about events triggered by this user. In your user profile, if you go to the \"network\" tab, you can see the list of users you are watching and the events that have been performed by them.",

Here are some steps you can take based on general knowledge and the provided search results:\n\n1. **Check Notification Settings**:\n    - Go to the notifications menu and look for a link to the settings of the notifications.\n    - Ensure that you have selected the types of notifications you want to receive. By default, you may only get notifications when you are mentioned or when actions are performed on pages you created or updated.\n    - Enable other types of notifications if needed, such as when a page is created or a blog post is published.\n\n2. **Email Notifications**:\n    - Make sure your email address is properly filled in your profile settings.\n    - You can edit the frequency of your email notifications in the notification preferences pane. Options typically include live notifications, daily recaps, etc.\n    - Check if there is a \"grace time\" set for live email notifications, which might delay the notifications.\n\n3. **Check for Filters**:\n    - Ensure that the \"Own event filter\" is switched off if you want to receive notifications for actions done by yourself.\n\n4. **Clear All Notifications**:\n    - If you have a lot of old notifications, you might want to clear them out to see new ones more easily. Use the \"Clear All\" link to remove all notifications that were sent till now.\n\nIf these steps don't resolve your issue, it might be helpful to consult the documentation or support resources specific to your platform.",
