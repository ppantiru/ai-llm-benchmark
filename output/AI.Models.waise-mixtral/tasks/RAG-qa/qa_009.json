  "prompt": "How can I deny script right to a space administrator?",
  "expected_answer": "This is unfortunately not supported in XWiki, rights that are implied by admin right cannot be denied.",
  "ai_answer": "https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Attachment/Validation/UI/ \nhttps://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Administration%20Application \nhttps://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Attachments \nhttps://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/LLM%20Application/Index%20for%20the%20LLM%20Application/ \n\n\n Based on the search results, there is no direct way to deny script rights to a space administrator as XWiki's access rights are based on permissions for specific pages or wiki-wide, not for specific features like running scripts.\n\nHowever, you can manage access rights in XWiki by using the built-in permission system. Here is a link to the documentation on how to manage permissions in XWiki: <https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/Admin/#HManagingPermissions>\n\nIf you want to restrict script execution, one solution could be to create a custom application with dedicated rights management for executing scripts, and then assign those rights only to the desired users or groups. Here is a link to the documentation on how to develop an XWiki extension: <https://developer.xwiki.org/xwiki/development-guide/>\n\nRegarding the provided sources, they contain information related to various aspects of XWiki, including attachments, validation constraints, and custom right management. However, none of them directly address your question about denying script rights to a space administrator.",
