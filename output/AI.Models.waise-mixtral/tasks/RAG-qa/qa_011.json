Based on the search results provided, I can share some information about how notifications work on XWiki, but please note that this might not be exactly what you're looking for, as I don't have specific information about your particular platform.\n\nOn XWiki, notifications are handled by the Notifications Application. By default, users receive notifications when they are mentioned or when actions are performed on pages they created or updated. However, they can customize which types of notifications they want to receive. For example, they can choose to be notified when a page is created or when a blog post is published.\n\nThere is also a Notifications Macro provided by its own application. This macro allows users to display notifications about events that happened on the wiki.\n\nAdditionally, XWiki has an Alerts Application that contributes content in the Alert menu, represented by a bell. This menu displays notifications about some events happening on the wiki, such as when a page has been modified or a new blog post has been posted. The number of unread notifications is displayed on the top menu, just above the bell.\n\nUsers can also decide to watch some entities, either a location (a page, a page with its children, or a wiki) or a user. To watch a location, they need to go to that place and click on the \"alert\" menu, represented by a bell. They can then choose to watch either this page, this page and its children, or the entire wiki.\n\nPlease note that I could not find information about a bell icon on the top right corner of the screen being available for notifications. Even if the Alert Notification extension is installed, this feature might not be available.",
