  "prompt": "We have one space per team. I want all teams to be able to view all spaces but each team should only be able to edit their own space. How can I configure this in XWiki?",
  "expected_answer": "To achieve the desired access control, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Create groups for each team**: Create a separate group for each team in your XWiki instance. This will allow you to manage access rights for each team individually.\n2. **Set wiki-wide rights**: Go to the wiki administration page and set the rights for the entire wiki. Specifically, set the \"View\" right to \"Allow\" for \"XWikiAllGroup\" to allow everyone to view all spaces.\n3. **Set space-level rights**: For each team's space, go to the space administration page and set the rights for that space. Specifically, set the \"Edit\" right to \"Allow\" only for the corresponding team's group. This will allow only the members of that team to edit their own space.\n4. **Inherit rights for child pages**: When setting rights for a space, make sure to select the \"Rights: Page & Children\" option to inherit the rights for all child pages within that space.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll ensure that:\n\n* All teams can view all spaces.\n* Each team can only edit their own space.\n\nRemember to adjust the rights accordingly for any additional teams or spaces you may have in your XWiki instance.",

Here are the steps you can follow:\n\n1. Create a new user or group for each team in XWiki. This can be done by going to the \"Administration\" section, then \"Users and Groups\", and then \"Add User\" or \"Add Group\". Make sure to give each user or group a unique name that corresponds to their team.\n2. Create a new space for each team in XWiki. This can be done by going to the \"Administration\" section, then \"Spaces\", and then \"Create Space\". Give each space a unique name that corresponds to its team.\n3. Set the access rights for each space so that all users can view the space but only the corresponding team can edit it. This can be done by going to the \"Space Administration\" section of each space, then \"Access Rights\", and then adding the appropriate user or group with \"Edit\" permissions for the space.\n4. To allow all teams to view all spaces, you need to set the access rights for each space so that everyone has \"View\" permissions. This can be done by going to the \"Space Administration\" section of each space, then \"Access Rights\", and then adding the \"XWiki All Users\" group with \"View\" permissions for the space.\n\nHere are some relevant links that provide more information about XWiki's access rights and wiki structure:\n\n* [Access Rights documentation](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/AccessRights/)\n* [Spaces documentation](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/UserGuide/Features/Spaces/)\n* [XWiki 7.2 release notes (for Space Reference instead of Space name)](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/ReleaseNotes/ReleaseNotesXWiki72#HSpaceReferenceinsteadofSpacen)\n\nPlease note that these instructions are based on the information provided in the XWiki documentation and may not cover all possible configurations or use cases.
