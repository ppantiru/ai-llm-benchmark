  "expected_answer": "Make sure that notifications are enabled. You can enable them by setting the `notifications.enabled` setting in `xwiki.properties` to `true`. Further, ensure that you're subscribed to the pages or users you want to receive notifications for. You can watch a page, a page and its children, or an entire wiki. To watch a location, all you need is to go to that place, and then click on the \"alert\" menu (represented by a bell) and enable the desired notifications. To follow a user, if you go to the profile of an user, using the User Index for example, you can see decide to watching a user. It means you will receive all notifications about events triggered by this user. In your user profile, if you go to the \"network\" tab, you can see the list of users you are watching and the events that have been performed by them.",
  "ai_answer": "https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Notifications%20Application/ \n\n\n Based on the search results, it seems that you're looking for information about the Notifications Application on XWiki. Here is a summary of the key points from the provided content:\n\n* The Notifications Application includes a Notifications Macro that provides a way to display and manage notifications.\n* Users can access the settings of the notifications from the menu, where they can select which types of notifications they want to receive (such as when a page is created or a blog post is published).\n* The list of notifications includes a button with a \"check\" icon that marks a notification as \"read\". In the future, users will be able to select whether they want to see only unread notifications or all of them.\n* When a notification is read, the button disappears and the background color changes.\n* Users can choose to receive an email every day with a recap of the events that have happened during the day. This feature can be customized by the wiki administrator.\n* The Notifications Application contributes content in the Alert menu (represented by a bell) in the top bar, where users can find notifications about various events happening on the wiki.\n* Users can clear all notifications that were sent till now with the \"Clear All\" link.\n* Similar notifications are grouped together to avoid a batch of identical content. Only one notification is displayed and it is possible to see the details of all activities in the \"Details\" section.\n\nHowever, I'm unable to provide specific information about your lack of notifications since there isn't enough context provided. It could be related to your settings or configuration of the Notifications Application.\n\nI hope this information helps! If you have any further questions, please let me know.",
