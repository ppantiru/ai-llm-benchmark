However, it's important to note that this means a sustained period of warming over 20 years, rather than just one year of high temperatures.",

Given that 1.5 \u00b0C was the goal set in the 2015 Paris Agreement, it seems an inauspicious milestone. As the mercury continues to rise, it s important to be clear about what exactly such milestones mean, while, at the same time, considering the prospects for mitigating further temperature increases.\\n\\nFirst, one year with 1.5 \u00b0C or so of warming or one day above 2 \u00b0C, as recorded by the European Union s Copernicus program in mid-November (5) doesn t mean we ve already reached those targets as laid out by the Paris Agreement. When climate scientists refer to targets to limit warming, they mean a sustained period generally 20 years during which the global temperature averages 1.5 \u00b0C or 2 \u00b0C above the years from 1850 to 1900 (6).\\n\\nMore importantly, actions taken by the world s n\"",

      "content": "\"y the world s nations right now can make a big difference in determining which path we take. Current policies, which fall somewhat short of pledges made to cut emissions, have the planet on course to warm by between 2.2 \u00b0C and 3.4 \u00b0C above preindustrial levels by the end of the century (7). The 1.5 \u00b0C Paris goal is likely beyond our grasp, but more aggressive action to cut greenhouse gas emissions could still limit global warming to less than 2 \u00b0C. And that would mean a massive reduction in the local consequences of climate change.  Every 10th of a degree matters,  says Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University in Lubbock and chief scientist with The Nature Conservancy.\\n\\nTo illustrate what different possible climate destinations mean in terms of deadly heat, debilitating droughts, and destructive floods, PNAS Front Matter has created a series of interactive maps and charts using projections compiled by Probable Futures, a nonprofit that aims to help governments, or\"",
