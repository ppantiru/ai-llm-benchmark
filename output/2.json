Given that 1.5 \u00b0C was the goal set in the 2015 Paris Agreement, it seems an inauspicious milestone. As the mercury continues to rise, it s important to be clear about what exactly such milestones mean, while, at the same time, considering the prospects for mitigating further temperature increases.\\n\\nFirst, one year with 1.5 \u00b0C or so of warming or one day above 2 \u00b0C, as recorded by the European Union s Copernicus program in mid-November (5) doesn t mean we ve already reached those targets as laid out by the Paris Agreement. When climate scientists refer to targets to limit warming, they mean a sustained period generally 20 years during which the global temperature averages 1.5 \u00b0C or 2 \u00b0C above the years from 1850 to 1900 (6).\\n\\nMore importantly, actions taken by the world s n\"",
