  "ai_answer": " WAISE is a project that aims to develop an AI-powered search engine integrating with platforms like XWiki. The core of the project is a WAISE server that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to answer user queries based on indexed content. The server will have two main user interfaces:\n\n1. Chat UI: Allows users to ask questions and receive answers based on context, with features like automatic fact-checking and the ability to ask follow-up questions.\n2. Administration UI: Manages the content that is indexed and controls the LLMs available for answering questions, allowing the creation of \"collections\" of documents from various sources.\n\nA Matrix bot will also be developed for similar functionalities. The key features of WAISE include context-based answers, multi-model support, and an Evaluation Framework to automatically index a collection of documents and run queries against WAISE. Optional features like logging and feedback, fact-checking, and personalization are also planned.",

      "content": "\"ramework\\n\\nThe document outlines the development of an Evaluation Framework aimed at automatically indexing a collection of documents and running queries against WAISE. The framework will measure various statistics like inference speed and memory consumption. The answers generated will initially be scored using a Language Learning Model (LLM). All test runs will be stored in a database for future comparison. Human rating will also be used to verify the reliability of the LLM-based scoring. The framework could be implemented in Python for easier data analysis and visualization.\\n\\n### Optional Features\\n\\n#### Logging and Feedback\\n\\nWAISE will include a Logging and Feedback mechanism to capture user interactions, system performance, and error events. This data will be accessible via an Administration UI and will help in system optimization and user experience enhancements. Users can also provide feedback on the quality of answers, which will be analyzed to improve the LLM's performance.\\n\\n####\"",

This will use another LLM model specifically trained for fact verification. The result will be displayed alongside the answer in the Chat UI, complete with an icon and textual description indicating the confidence level of the fact-checking.\\n\\n#### Personalization\\n\\nWAISE aims to offer personalized responses based on a user's historical interactions. User profiles capturing preferences, interaction history, and feedback will be created. The system will use this data to tailor search results and provide more contextually relevant information. Integration with XWiki's user management system will offer additional insights into user roles and interaction patterns.\\n\\n\\n\"",
