The project will primarily consist of a WAISE server that will answer user queries using Large Language Models (LLMs) based on indexed content. The server will have two main user interfaces:\\n\\n1. **Chat UI**: Allows users to ask questions and receive answers based on context. It will be embeddable in other applications and will have features like automatic fact-checking and the ability to ask follow-up questions. Rate limits may apply.\\n    \\n2. **Administration UI**: Manages the content that is indexed and controls the LLMs available for answering questions. It allows the creation of \\\"collections\\\" of documents that can be indexed from various sources.\\n    \\n\\nAdditionally, a Matrix bot will be developed for similar functionalities.\\n\\n### Key Features:\\n\\n- **Context-Based Answers**: Answers will be provided based on the content indexed by the WAISE server.\\n    \\n- **Multi-Model Suppor\"",
