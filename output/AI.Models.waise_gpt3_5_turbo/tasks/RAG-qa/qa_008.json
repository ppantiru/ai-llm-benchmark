  "expected_answer": "To ensure that only images or PDF files of at maximum 10MB can be uploaded as attachments on the whole wiki, follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Configure allowed mimetypes**\n\nEdit the `xwiki.properties` configuration file in your installation and add or update the following line to configure the default mimetype restrictions at farm level:\n```\nattachment.upload.allowList=image/*,application/pdf\n```\nThis will allow only image files (with any subtype, e.g., `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, etc.) and PDF files to be uploaded, and block all other mimetypes.\n\n**Step 2: Configure maximum attachment size**\n\nTo set the maximum attachment size to 10MB, follow these steps:\n\n1. Go to `http://<yourwiki>/xwiki/bin/edit/XWiki/XWikiPreferences?editor=object`\n2. Click on the line that says XWikiPreferences 0 (right below the line that says Objects of type XWiki.XWikiPreferences (1))\n3. Scroll down to the field that says Maximum Upload Size and change the number to `10485760` (10MB in bytes)\n4. Scroll to the bottom and click \"Save\"\n5. Repeat for each (sub)wiki for which you need to set this configuration!",

This allows you to set restrictions on the types of files that can be uploaded.\n   \n2. **Size Limit**:\n   - The maximum size of an attachment can be set by the administrator. By default, it is set at about 32 megabytes. You can adjust this to 10MB to meet your requirements.\n\n3. **Attachment Validation Application**:\n   - The Attachment Validation Application provides UI and configuration for attachment validation. This extension allows for client-side validations for size and mimetype attachment validations.\n\nFor detailed instructions on how to configure these settings, you can refer to the [administrator's guide to attachments](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Attachments).",
