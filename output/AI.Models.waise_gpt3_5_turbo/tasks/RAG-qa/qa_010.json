  "prompt": "We have one space per team. I want all teams to be able to view all spaces but each team should only be able to edit their own space. How can I configure this in XWiki?",
  "expected_answer": "To achieve the desired access control, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Create groups for each team**: Create a separate group for each team in your XWiki instance. This will allow you to manage access rights for each team individually.\n2. **Set wiki-wide rights**: Go to the wiki administration page and set the rights for the entire wiki. Specifically, set the \"View\" right to \"Allow\" for \"XWikiAllGroup\" to allow everyone to view all spaces.\n3. **Set space-level rights**: For each team's space, go to the space administration page and set the rights for that space. Specifically, set the \"Edit\" right to \"Allow\" only for the corresponding team's group. This will allow only the members of that team to edit their own space.\n4. **Inherit rights for child pages**: When setting rights for a space, make sure to select the \"Rights: Page & Children\" option to inherit the rights for all child pages within that space.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll ensure that:\n\n* All teams can view all spaces.\n* Each team can only edit their own space.\n\nRemember to adjust the rights accordingly for any additional teams or spaces you may have in your XWiki instance.",

This will restrict editing capabilities to the designated team members.\n3. **Utilize User Groups**:\n   - Create user groups for each team.\n   - Assign team members to their respective user groups.\n   - Use these user groups when setting up access rights to simplify management.\n\nBy configuring access rights in this manner, you can ensure that all teams can view all spaces while maintaining editing restrictions to their own space. For detailed instructions specific to XWiki's interface and settings, you may refer to the XWiki documentation or seek assistance from XWiki support resources.",
