  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.71 because the response provides some relevant information regarding enabling notifications for own actions, but includes irrelevant URLs that do not directly address the input question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions at all. Fantastic job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context! Keep up the great work!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the first three nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input query. The first node discusses general settings and types of notifications but does not mention enabling notifications for one's own actions. The second node lists various notification-related macros and preferences but lacks information on the specific issue of receiving notifications for one's own activity. The third node talks about enabling notifications for all users by default and other administrative settings, which is not relevant to the user's query. The relevant nodes, which mention that users won't receive notifications for their own actions by default and provide a way to change this behavior, are ranked fourth and fifth. Therefore, the score is not higher because the relevant nodes are not ranked higher than the irrelevant ones.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the expected output aligns perfectly with the information provided in the 5th node in the retrieval context, ensuring a comprehensive and accurate match. Great job!"
