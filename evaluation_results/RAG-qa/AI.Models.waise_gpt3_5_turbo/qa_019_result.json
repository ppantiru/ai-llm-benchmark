  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.83 because the overall answer is relevant but contains repeated irrelevant statements about the URL not being related to managing script rights for a space administrator in XWiki.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context! Keep up the excellent work!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input question. The first node contains \"image links and references to various projects and entities,\" which do not address the question about denying script rights to a space administrator. The second node describes \"attributes related to 'defaultEditMode' and examples of getting a list of users,\" which also does not answer the question. The third node repeats the irrelevant details of the first node, and the fourth node discusses \"job parameters for a REST API related to job execution,\" which is not pertinent to the question. Therefore, no relevant nodes were ranked higher than irrelevant nodes, resulting in a score of 0.00.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context does not provide any information about the support of certain rights in XWiki or the inability to deny rights implied by admin rights, focusing instead on images and properties for objects."
