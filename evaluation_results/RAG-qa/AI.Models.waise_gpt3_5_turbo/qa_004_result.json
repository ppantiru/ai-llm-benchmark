    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer perfectly addresses the question without any irrelevant information. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context! Keep up the excellent work!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.25 because the relevant node that directly addresses the 'Automatic page watching' feature is ranked fourth, while the first three nodes are irrelevant. The first node talks about clearing notifications and changing the 'Own event filter,' the second mentions the Notifications Macro and settings, and the third discusses system and custom filters. These do not provide information on how to disable notifications or change settings related to 'Automatic page watching,' leading to a low score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.75 because while nodes in the retrieval context cover most of the expected output, there is no mention about deleting existing notification filters, which affects completeness."
