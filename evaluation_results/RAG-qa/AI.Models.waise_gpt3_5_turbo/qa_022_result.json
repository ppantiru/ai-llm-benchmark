  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the issue of not receiving notifications. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.67 because the claim that \"You do not receive notifications\" contradicts the context, which states that users do receive notifications by default when they are mentioned or when actions are performed on pages they created or updated.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the relevant node, which \"provides relevant details about watching entities and following locations or users,\" is ranked second. The first node, which \"mainly discusses the notification settings and types of notifications available,\" should be ranked lower as it is not directly relevant to enabling notifications or following pages/users. Additionally, the third node, which \"is more about the visual representation and management of notifications,\" should also be ranked lower. This misranking of irrelevant nodes above the relevant one results in a reduced score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.25 because the retrieval context only partially matches the expected output, specifically addressing how to follow pages and use the alert menu, but missing key details about activating notifications, setting properties, following users, and viewing user activities."
