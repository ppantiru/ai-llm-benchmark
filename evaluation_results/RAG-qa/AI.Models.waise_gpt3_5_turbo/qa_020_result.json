  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.73 because while the actual output provides relevant information about configuring team access and permissions in XWiki, it includes several irrelevant links that do not directly address the specific question about setting up team-specific viewing and editing permissions.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.91 because the retrieval context does not support the claim that all teams can see all areas but can only edit their own area; it only mentions adding users to groups and managing rights.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.58 because the relevant nodes (ranked 2 and 3) are not consistently ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes. For instance, the first node is irrelevant as it \"contains image links and references to various projects and is not relevant to configuring access control in XWiki,\" yet it is ranked higher than the relevant nodes that \"provide a link to more information about managing users and groups in XWiki\" (ranked 2) and \"explain how to manage user groups in XWiki\" (ranked 3). Additionally, irrelevant nodes discussing \"query groups and access rights for collections in a different context\" (ranked 4) and \"group synchronization and customization for OpenID Connect\" (ranked 5) should be ranked lower. Thus, while some relevant nodes are correctly placed, the presence of higher-ranked irrelevant nodes lowers the overall score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the nodes in the retrieval context mention any of the steps, rights settings, or reminders related to achieving access control as described in the expected output."
