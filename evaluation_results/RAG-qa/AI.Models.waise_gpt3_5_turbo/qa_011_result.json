  },
  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.67 because the actual output includes URLs to documentation and extension pages that do not directly address the issue about the notification bell not being available, which makes the response partially irrelevant.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Excellent job on ensuring the actual output aligns perfectly with the retrieval context! Keep up the great work!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all the nodes in the retrieval context are relevant and appropriately ranked. Each node provides pertinent information about enabling notifications, configuring settings, and the functionality of the notification bell, aligning perfectly with the input query. Great job!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because, while the retrieval context mentions notifications and their settings, it lacks specific details about the `notifications.enabled` setting or setting it to `true`, which are crucial to fully aligning with the expected output."
