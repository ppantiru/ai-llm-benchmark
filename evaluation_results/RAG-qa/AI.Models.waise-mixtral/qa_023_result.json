  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.67 because while the output includes several links and statements that are not directly addressing the question about enabling notifications for one's own actions, it still provides some relevant information related to notifications in general.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context! Keep up the excellent work!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.20 because only the fifth node is relevant to the input, stating, \"By default, you won't receive notifications for actions done by yourself. This can be changed by switching off the Own event filter,\" which directly addresses the question. However, this relevant node is ranked last (5th), while the first four nodes are irrelevant, discussing general settings, various notification-related macros, enabling notifications for all users, and listing preferences, none of which address the specific issue of receiving notifications for one's own actions. This misranking significantly lowers the score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because the 5th node in the retrieval context supports the first sentence of the expected output, but there is no information in the retrieval context about \"Options de filtrage avanc\u00e9es\" or a similar section, which affects the second sentence."
