  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response perfectly addresses the question about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider, providing clear and relevant instructions. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.93 because the actual output claims you need to set the `xwiki.authentication.authclass` property in the `xwiki.cfg` configuration file to `org.xwiki.contrib.oidc.auth.OIDCAuthServiceImpl`, which is not mentioned in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.75 because the relevant nodes are mostly ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes. For instance, the first node is relevant as it discusses \"mapping between the XWiki groups and the provider groups using oidc.groups.mapping property,\" which directly relates to configuring group synchronization. The fourth node, also relevant, mentions setting properties in the 'xwiki.properties' file, which is crucial for the configuration process. However, the second and third nodes, which primarily list links to customization resources and discuss release notes and limitations, are irrelevant and should be ranked lower. The presence of these irrelevant nodes in higher positions lowers the overall precision score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.15 because the retrieval context only partially addresses the expected output, specifically mentioning the mapping of XWiki groups to provider groups using the `oidc.groups.mapping` property. However, it lacks details on key steps such as locating and editing the `xwiki.properties` file, configuring other properties like `oidc.groups.claim` and `oidc.groups.separator`, and saving changes."
