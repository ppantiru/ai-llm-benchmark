  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.80 because the actual output provided several URLs that did not directly address the question about denying script rights to a space administrator. However, the score is still relatively high because the content was mostly relevant and on-topic.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context! Keep up the excellent work!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all the nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node pertains to \"setting validation constraints in a map,\" which does not address denying script rights to a domain administrator. The second node discusses \"authentication against LDAP,\" unrelated to script rights. The third node is about \"attributes related to the default edit mode and retrieving a list of users,\" which is also not relevant. The fourth node involves \"setting parameters for user registration fields,\" which does not concern script rights. Finally, the fifth node explains \"validation options such as mustMatch and programmaticValidation,\" which again does not relate to the topic. As all nodes are irrelevant, the contextual precision score remains at 0.00.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the nodes in the retrieval context discuss the support or denial of rights within XWiki, nor do they mention the implications of admin rights or the inability to refuse such rights in XWiki."
