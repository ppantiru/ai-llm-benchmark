  },
  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.94 because the answer is highly relevant and addresses the issue about the bell icon's availability, but the inclusion of an unrelated URL slightly detracts from its precision. Keep up the great work and stay focused on the core question!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.85 because the actual output includes details about the Notifications Macro and the Alert menu displaying notifications about events on the wiki, such as page modifications or new blog posts, which are not mentioned in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all nodes in the retrieval contexts are highly relevant and ranked correctly. Each node discusses aspects directly related to notifications in the wiki, such as enabling notifications, configuring notification settings, the alert menu, and user profile notification settings. Great job!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the retrieval context mentions 'notifications' and 'settings' related to notifications, it does not specify the setting `notifications.enabled` in `xwiki.properties`, which is crucial for ensuring notifications are enabled in the wiki."
