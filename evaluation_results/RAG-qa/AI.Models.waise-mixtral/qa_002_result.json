  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.39 because the output contains numerous statements that do not directly address the issue of not receiving notifications, such as descriptions of features, future updates, and general offers for further questions. This dilutes the relevance of the response, preventing it from being higher. However, the score is not lower because some parts of the output do touch on aspects related to notifications, even if they are not directly addressing the main issue.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job! Keep up the excellent work!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.25 because the relevant node (rank 4) that mentions the Alert menu and provides useful information on enabling notifications is ranked lower than three irrelevant nodes. These irrelevant nodes (rank 1, rank 2, and rank 3) discuss topics such as the Notifications Macro, marking notifications as read, and the frequency and grouping of email notifications, none of which directly address enabling notifications or subscribing to pages and users. The placement of these irrelevant nodes higher than the relevant node significantly lowers the precision score. However, the score is not zero because there is at least one relevant node present in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.78 because the retrieval context accurately covers most aspects of the expected output, such as subscribing to notifications, watching pages and users, and the 'network' tab in the user profile. However, it lacks specific details about enabling notifications via `xwiki.properties`."
