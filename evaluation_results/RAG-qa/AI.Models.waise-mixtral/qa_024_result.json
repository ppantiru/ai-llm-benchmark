  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.73 because while the output contains some useful information about notifications, it includes multiple irrelevant statements that do not directly address how to disable unwanted notifications, such as links to syntax documentation and explanations about receiving additional notifications.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on ensuring the actual output aligns perfectly with the retrieval context! Keep up the excellent work!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node, which explains that users can change notification settings to stop receiving unwanted notifications, is ranked third. This means two irrelevant nodes are ranked higher. The first node discusses default notification settings without providing a direct solution, and the second node talks about creating global notification filters, which is not relevant. This misranking lowers the precision score. However, the relevant node is still present, which is why the score is not zero.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because only the first two sentences of the expected output can be attributed to the 3rd node in the retrieval context, while the remaining sentences about modifying the \"Suivi automatique des pages\" parameter and removing existing notification filters are not found in any of the nodes in the retrieval context."
