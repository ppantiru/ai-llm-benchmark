  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.82 because the output addresses the main issue of configuring automatic user activation with OpenID Connect in XWiki, but includes irrelevant statements about the lack of relevant search results and repeats the lack of specific information, which do not directly help solve the problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.88 because the retrieval context does not mention the property `oidc.enableUser` or its configuration in xwiki.cfg.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node (ranked 3rd) discussing the `oidc.enableUser=true` property is ranked lower than several irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node discusses \"various aspects of OpenID Connect and Active Directory integration\" without mentioning the specific property needed. Similarly, the second node provides links to configurations but fails to address the automatic user activation. These irrelevant nodes should be ranked lower to improve the score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.60 because while the 3rd node in the retrieval context mentions the property `oidc.enableUser=true` and provides relevant details, it does not explicitly cover adding or updating properties or guarantee automatic activation of user accounts, which are crucial parts of the expected output."
