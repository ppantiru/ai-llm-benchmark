  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.55 because the actual output contains multiple irrelevant statements that do not directly address the question about denying script rights to a space administrator.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions at all. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context! Keep up the excellent work!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all the nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses \"specifying a list of allowed or blocked attachment mimetypes,\" which does not pertain to denying script rights to a space administrator. Similarly, the second node talks about \"validation using 'pattern' and other form validation techniques,\" which is unrelated. The third node is about \"setting validation parameters for form fields,\" which also does not address the input question. The fourth node is about \"downloading attachments and specifying whitelist or blacklist for attachment types,\" which is not relevant. Finally, the fifth node discusses \"using the updateOrCreate object policy in a script,\" which does not relate to the input question. Therefore, the score is not higher because none of the nodes are relevant, resulting in a contextual precision score of 0.00.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the sentence \"This is unfortunately not supported in XWiki, rights that are implied by admin right cannot be denied.\" does not match any content in the provided retrieval context. No nodes in the retrieval context discuss rights or admin rights."
