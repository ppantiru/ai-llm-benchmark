  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.86 because the actual output provides relevant information regarding the \"Bell\" in the top right corner issue, but includes URLs that are not directly related to solving the specific problem mentioned.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.75 because the actual output inaccurately describes the process of watching a location, incorrectly states the settings are in the notifications menu, and wrongly claims the bell icon is not available in the top right corner.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input, and they are ranked higher than any potentially relevant nodes. For instance, the first node mainly \"describes how notifications are loaded and marked as read,\" which does not address the issue of the \"Bell\" icon being unavailable. Similarly, the second node \"explains the notification bell icon and the notifications menu,\" but it also does not provide information on enabling notifications. The third node lists various macros without mentioning how to enable notifications, and the fourth node discusses filtering minor events, which is unrelated to the input. Finally, the fifth node describes notification settings but does not mention enabling notifications. Therefore, the contextual precision score is low because all the nodes ranked are irrelevant to the input query.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context does not mention enabling notifications in the wiki or setting `notifications.enabled` to `true` in `xwiki.properties`."
