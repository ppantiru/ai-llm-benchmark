  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.64 because the actual output includes multiple irrelevant URLs that do not address the question about enabling notifications for one's own actions. However, the score is not lower because there may still be some relevant information present.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context! Keep up the excellent work!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all the nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input question about enabling notifications for one's own activity. The first node contains URLs and image links related to various references and applications, which are not relevant. The second node discusses extensions and flavors in XWiki, which is also unrelated. The third node is about content editing features like section editing and editing profiles, which do not pertain to notifications. The fourth node describes an application for administrating wiki features like users and groups, which does not provide the needed information. The fifth node discusses skins, internationalization, and accessibility features, which are unrelated to the question. Therefore, all irrelevant nodes were ranked higher, resulting in a score of 0.00.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context does not mention notifications for one's own activity or any advanced filter options in the user notification settings, which are key details in the expected output."
