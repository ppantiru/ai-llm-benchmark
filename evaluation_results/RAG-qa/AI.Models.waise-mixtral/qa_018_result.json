  },
  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.82 because the actual output contains multiple URL links to pages about Exports, XWiki Syntax, and Configuration, which do not directly address the question about limiting attachment types and sizes. However, the relevant parts of the response still provide useful information related to the question.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect faithfulness to the retrieval context!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node discusses \"exporting pages to PDF and DOC formats,\" which does not address restricting file types or sizes for uploads. Similarly, the second node mentions \"various macros and document viewers\" without providing information on configuring attachment restrictions. The third node, which discusses \"export types including PDF,\" also fails to give relevant information about restricting uploads to specific file types or sizes. The fourth node provides tips for \"downloading PDF classes and templates,\" unrelated to upload restrictions. Lastly, the fifth node focuses on \"customizing PDF covers and footers,\" which does not pertain to setting upload restrictions for file types or sizes. Thus, the score reflects that all retrieved contexts are irrelevant to the input question.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the nodes in the retrieval context provide information related to configuring MIME types, editing the `xwiki.properties` file, setting maximum attachment sizes, or any steps related to uploading images or PDF files with a maximum size of 10 MB."
