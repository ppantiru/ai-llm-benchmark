  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.80 because the actual output provides useful information related to configuring access rights in XWiki, which addresses the core of the input question. However, it includes several irrelevant links to general XWiki concepts, content organization, nested pages migration, and export features, which do not directly help in configuring the specific access rights scenario described.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect faithfulness to the retrieval context! Keep up the excellent work!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all the nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node discusses \"controlling panels and columns in XWiki,\" which doesn't relate to configuring access control for spaces. Similarly, the second node is about \"migrating to Nested Pages in XWiki,\" and the third node addresses \"changes in XWiki's handling of space names after version 7.2,\" neither of which help in setting view and edit rights for teams. The fourth node discusses \"the concepts of 'Page' and 'Space' in XWiki and the introduction of Nested Pages,\" and the fifth node provides \"examples of exporting pages from XWiki,\" both unrelated to the required configuration. Hence, the score remains low as no relevant nodes are ranked higher.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context lacks specific instructions on creating groups, setting wiki-wide and space-level rights, inheriting rights for child pages, and adjusting rights for additional teams or spaces."
