  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the output directly addresses the question about configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider, providing clear and relevant steps without any irrelevant information. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.70 because the actual output inaccurately claims that new XWiki groups will be created based on group claims from the OpenID Connect provider and that setting the `xwiki.authentication.createuser` property to `empty` will automatically create new groups during group synchronization. The retrieval context does not support these specific claims.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.70 because, while the first node is highly relevant as it directly mentions the 'oidc.groups.mapping property', the second, third, and fourth nodes are irrelevant, discussing 'Release notes', 'Main limitations', and 'connecting XWiki to an Active Directory server' respectively. These irrelevant nodes should be ranked lower. The fifth node is also relevant, discussing the 'xwiki.properties' file and 'oidc.provider', which are pertinent to configuring the OpenID Connect provider settings in XWiki. The presence of these irrelevant nodes before another relevant node reduces the overall score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.31 because while some instructions related to configuring properties like `oidc.groups.claim`, `oidc.groups.separator`, and `oidc.groups.mapping` can be traced to the 1st node in the retrieval context, many specific steps such as locating and editing the `xwiki.properties` file, replacing values, and saving and restarting the XWiki instance are not found in the retrieval context."
