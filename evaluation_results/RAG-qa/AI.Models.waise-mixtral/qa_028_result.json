  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.75 because while the response does provide some useful information, it includes multiple URLs that are not directly relevant to the specific query about restricting attachment types and sizes. These URLs are general guides and do not specifically address the question, thereby reducing the overall relevancy of the answer.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions at all. Great job on maintaining perfect faithfulness to the retrieval context! Keep up the excellent work!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node is ranked third instead of being at the top. The first node discusses configuring document properties and attaching files without addressing MIME type restrictions or size limits, which is not relevant to the input. Similarly, the second node talks about transforming XML documents and exporting them to PDF/RTF, which is also unrelated. These irrelevant nodes should be ranked lower than the third node, which directly provides steps to set the maximum size of an attachment, making it highly relevant to the input.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the instructions or details in the expected output, including configuring MIME types, modifying the `xwiki.properties` file, setting the maximum attachment size, or specific steps for editing XWikiPreferences, are mentioned in any part of the nodes in the retrieval context."
