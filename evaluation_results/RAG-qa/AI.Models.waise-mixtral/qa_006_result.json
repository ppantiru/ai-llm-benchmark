  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the output is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the question about customizing user profile fields from the OpenID Connect provider in XWiki. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining complete alignment with the retrieval context! Keep up the excellent work!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes are correctly ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes. The first node provides an example of mapping custom properties using the `oidc.user.mapping` property, which is directly relevant to the input query. The subsequent nodes discuss modifying the user profile during updates, enabling DEBUG logs, OpenID Connect protocol response types and scopes, configuring the OIDC authenticator, and requesting user profile fields, none of which directly address the customization of user profile fields, hence their lower ranking. Great job!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.60 because while the retrieval context accurately discusses mapping user profile fields in the `xwiki.properties` file and provides an example of using the `oidc.user.mapping` property, it lacks specific instructions on replacing placeholders and does not mention saving the file or restarting XWiki."
