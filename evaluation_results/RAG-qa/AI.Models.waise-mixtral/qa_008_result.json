  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.90 because while the majority of the response directly addresses the question about ensuring only images or PDF files of up to 10MB can be uploaded, there are minor irrelevant references that slightly detract from the overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.92 because the actual output incorrectly states that the 'Maximum Upload Size' should be changed to 10MB, whereas the retrieval context indicates that the default maximum size of an attachment is 100GB.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.70 because the relevant nodes are not consistently ranked higher than the irrelevant ones. Specifically, the second node, which \"mentions clearing the browser's cache and mimetype restriction validation but does not provide specific steps or configuration details relevant to the expected output,\" and the third node, which \"mentions the default maximum attachment size but does not provide the detailed steps or configuration settings needed for the expected output,\" should be ranked lower than the first node, which \"provides detailed steps on how to configure the maximum size of an attachment in the XWikiPreferences document.\" Additionally, the fifth node, which \"provides information about configuring the default mimetype restrictions at the farm level in the xwiki.properties file,\" should be ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes. This inconsistency in ranking results in a score of 0.70 rather than higher.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.67 because while the retrieval context provides general information about configuring mimetypes and setting maximum attachment size, it lacks specific details mentioned in the expected output, such as restricting uploads to images or PDF files and setting the maximum size to 10MB."
