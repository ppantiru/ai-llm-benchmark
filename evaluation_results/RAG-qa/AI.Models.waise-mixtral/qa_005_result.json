  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.85 because the provided output contains useful information about configuring OpenID Connect in XWiki, but it includes irrelevant and duplicate links that do not directly address the issue of automatically enabling user accounts upon first login.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.92 because the actual output incorrectly claims that a new object of class `XWiki.OIDC.ClientConfigurationClass` specifically defines the `oidc.enableUser` property, whereas the retrieval context only states that new OIDC Client configurations can be defined through objects of this class, without mentioning the specific property.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node, which \"contains the exact configuration property `# oidc.enableUser=true` that needs to be set in the `xwiki.properties` file,\" is correctly ranked first. All subsequent nodes are irrelevant as they discuss topics like unrelated configurations, dependencies, LDAP configuration, and various authentication mechanisms without providing the necessary information for enabling user accounts on first login using OpenID Connect. Great job on ensuring the most pertinent information is prioritized!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because, while the retrieval context includes information about adjusting the `xwiki.properties` file and the property `# oidc.enableUser=true`, it lacks details on uncommenting and setting the property to true, saving the file, restarting XWiki, and ensuring new user accounts are automatically enabled on first login via OpenID Connect."
