  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.90 because the answer is mostly relevant and addresses the question about customizing user profile fields in XWiki, but it includes a URL that does not directly contribute to the explanation.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context! Keep up the excellent work!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the relevant node, which discusses the `xwiki.properties` file and provides an example of its configuration, is ranked second. This node should be ranked higher since it directly addresses mapping user profile fields. The first node only provides general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator, which is not relevant to customizing or mapping user profile fields. Additionally, the third, fourth, and fifth nodes discuss various settings, configuration links, and setup instructions, none of which are pertinent to the input question.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.60 because the retrieval context provides general information about configuring OpenID Connect settings in the `xwiki.properties` file and mentions saving changes and restarting XWiki. However, it lacks specific examples and detailed instructions for mapping user properties, which are crucial parts of the expected output."
