  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.85 because while the response provides useful documentation links, they do not directly address the specific question about refusing script rights to a space administrator.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.50 because the actual output incorrectly states that the 'Script' right can be set specifically for a space administrator, while the retrieval context clarifies that this right is controlled at the page and wiki level, not for specific roles like space administrators.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all the nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node mentions that administrators can revoke script rights for some users or groups, but it does not address the inability to refuse script rights to administrators. The second node describes how script rights can be granted or denied, but again, does not specifically mention that administrators cannot be refused script rights. The third node provides detailed information about the 'Script' right but does not address the specific case of denying script rights to administrators. The fourth node talks about the 'Script' right and its default settings but does not state that administrators cannot be refused script rights. The fifth node contains a link to more documentation but does not provide information relevant to the question about refusing script rights to administrators. Since all nodes are irrelevant, the contextual precision score is appropriately low.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the sentence in the expected output perfectly aligns with the relevant information from the nodes in the retrieval context, demonstrating excellent contextual recall. Great job!"
