  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.76 because the output includes several statements that provide general information, context, and disclaimers that do not directly address the specific question of how to disable unwanted notifications. However, it still provides some relevant information, which is why the score is not lower.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions present. Great job on ensuring the actual output aligns perfectly with the retrieval context! Keep up the excellent work!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.25 because the relevant node, which provides instructions on changing notification settings for pages the user is not interested in, is ranked fourth. The first three nodes are irrelevant as they discuss removing all notifications, the Notifications Macro, and system filters, none of which address the user's specific query. The low ranking of the relevant node significantly reduces the precision score. However, the score is not zero because the relevant node is present in the list.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.75 because the retrieval context accurately covers the automatic addition of pages to the watchlist and notification settings but lacks information about deleting existing notification filters in the \"Custom Filters\" list."
