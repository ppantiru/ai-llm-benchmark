  },
  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.83 because the output provides some useful information related to configuring permissions in XWiki, but it includes several irrelevant links that do not directly address the specific question about configuring team permissions.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.93 because the actual output incorrectly states that users are added to the group by clicking 'Add', whereas the retrieval context specifies that users are added by clicking the 'X' button located at the top right.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all the nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node provides a link to more information about managing users and groups but does not address configuring team-specific access and editing rights in XWiki. The second node explains how to create and manage user groups, which is somewhat related but does not cover the specific steps needed. The third node discusses querying groups and access rights methods, which is not relevant. The fourth node talks about group synchronization and custom group mappings, which is not directly relevant. The fifth node provides information about the RESTful API and root resources, which is also not relevant. Thus, the irrelevant nodes were ranked higher, resulting in a low score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.12 because only a few sentences from the expected output, specifically sentences 1 and 2, can be directly linked to nodes in the retrieval context, while the majority of the content is not supported by the retrieval context nodes."
