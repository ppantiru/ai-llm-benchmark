  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.74 because while the response provides some relevant information, it includes multiple URLs and statements that do not directly address the specific question about configuring access rights and permissions in XWiki. This extraneous information detracts from the overall relevancy, preventing a higher score. However, the score is not lower because the response does contain some useful guidance related to the query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.87 because the actual output incorrectly suggests creating a separate space for each team and refers to a 'Space' administration page, whereas the retrieval context states that the notion of space has been removed from the UI in XWiki.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node discusses the removal of the notion of space and the emulation of sub-pages and sub-spaces, but it does not provide any information about setting access rights for different teams. Similarly, the second node talks about changes related to the creation of spaces and code adaptation but does not address setting permissions for different teams. This pattern continues across all nodes, with none providing relevant steps or guidance on configuring access rights for different teams in XWiki.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context does not provide any information related to the specific steps, group creation, rights definition at different levels, inheritance of rights, or the visibility and modification permissions for teams as outlined in the expected output."
