  },
  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.86 because the response contains useful and relevant information about restricting file uploads to images or PDFs with a maximum size of 10 MB. However, it includes several irrelevant links to general documentation that do not directly address the specific question asked.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Excellent job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context! Keep up the great work!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval contexts are ranked improperly. All nodes in the retrieval context discuss topics unrelated to the input query, such as \"exporting a page to PDF and DOC formats\" (first node), \"various macros and their usage\" (second node), and \"customizing PDF covers and footers\" (fifth node). These contexts do not address file upload restrictions, which is the focus of the input query. Therefore, the irrelevant nodes are ranked higher than any relevant information, resulting in a very low contextual precision score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context does not provide any information or steps related to ensuring only images or PDF files of a specific size can be uploaded, configuring allowable MIME types, editing the `xwiki.properties` file, setting MIME type restrictions, or configuring maximum attachment size via XWikiPreferences."
