  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.92 because the response is mostly relevant and provides useful information on mapping user profile fields from the OpenID Connect provider to XWiki. However, it includes some irrelevant details about the base URL of the OpenID Connect provider, which do not directly address the question about customizing user profile fields.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions! Great job maintaining perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Keep up the fantastic work!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the relevant node is ranked second, while the first node is irrelevant. The first node \"provides a general introduction to the OpenID Connect Authenticator and does not address the specific question about mapping user profile fields,\" which should be ranked lower. The second node, which is relevant, \"mentions `xwiki.properties` and the use of the OpenID Connect provider,\" addressing the specific question about customizing user profile fields. The remaining nodes are also irrelevant and correctly ranked lower.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the retrieval context perfectly matches all the details in the expected output, covering everything from configuring OpenID Connect in `xwiki.properties` to providing examples and instructions for saving and restarting XWiki. Great job!"
