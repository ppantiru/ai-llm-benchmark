  },
  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.91 because the majority of the response is highly relevant and provides useful information, but the inclusion of a general link to XWiki syntax documentation and a vague statement about finding more information detracts slightly from the overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context! Keep up the excellent work!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant and do not address the input query about enabling notifications in the wiki settings. For example, the first node discusses \"various notification macros and their functionalities\" but not enabling notifications, making it irrelevant. Similarly, the second node describes \"visual aspects and user interactions with the notifications interface\" without providing information on enabling notifications, which is also irrelevant. This pattern continues throughout all nodes, leading to a score of 0.00.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because while the retrieval context nodes mention 'notifications' and settings related to them, they do not refer to defining the property `notifications.enabled` in `xwiki.properties`."
