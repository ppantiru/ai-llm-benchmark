  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.82 because, while the response addresses the issue of not receiving notifications, it includes several irrelevant URLs that do not pertain to the problem, slightly detracting from the overall relevance.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions present. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context! Keep up the excellent work!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input \"Ich erhalte keine Benachrichtigungen.\" The first node contains a broken URL and no relevant information about notifications. The second node lists image references and URLs unrelated to notifications. The third node mentions an image reference without providing any notification-related information. Lastly, the fourth node also includes image references and URLs that are not relevant to enabling notifications. As a result, irrelevant nodes are ranked higher, leading to a low contextual precision score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the nodes in the retrieval context provide information about activating notifications, setting `notifications.enabled` in `xwiki.properties`, following pages or users, clicking a bell icon, following a user via their profile, receiving notifications about user-triggered events, or the 'Netzwerk' tab in the user profile."
