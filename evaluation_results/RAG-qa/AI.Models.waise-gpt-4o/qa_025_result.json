  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer directly addresses the specific configuration needed to automatically activate user accounts upon their first login using OpenID Connect in XWiki, with no irrelevant statements present. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect faithfulness to the retrieval context! Keep up the excellent work!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node discussing the property `oidc.enableUser` in the `xwiki.properties` file and providing the exact configuration needed is ranked third. The first and second nodes, which focus on the `xwiki.cfg` file and general OpenID Connect options without mentioning the specific property `oidc.enableUser`, are ranked higher. This misranking of irrelevant nodes above the relevant one lowers the score. However, the score is not zero because the relevant information is still present, albeit not in the highest ranks.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.67 because the retrieval context accurately references the need to set the `oidc.enableUser` property to `true` (as seen in node 3), but it does not mention the necessity of adding or updating properties or restarting the XWiki instance."
