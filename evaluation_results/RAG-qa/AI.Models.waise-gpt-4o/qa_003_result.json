  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.78 because the provided URLs are not directly relevant to the question about enabling notifications for one's own actions, which slightly detracts from the overall relevance of the response.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Fantastic job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context! Keep up the great work!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked lower than the irrelevant ones. Specifically, the first three nodes primarily discuss notification settings and macros but do not address receiving notifications about one's own activity. The fourth node, ranked lower, mentions, \"a page where you have made a major modification is automatically added to the list of pages you watch,\" which is relevant. The fifth node, which directly answers the question by stating, \"you won\u2019t receive notifications for actions done by yourself. This can be changed by switching off the Own event filter,\" should be ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the retrieval context perfectly aligns with the expected output, accurately capturing all key details without any discrepancies. Great job!"
