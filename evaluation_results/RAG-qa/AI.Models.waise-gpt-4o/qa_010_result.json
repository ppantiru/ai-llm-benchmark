  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.88 because while the output provides some useful information, it includes multiple URLs that do not directly address the specific query about configuring permissions in XWiki. This dilutes the overall relevance of the response. However, the score is relatively high because the provided URLs and information are still somewhat related and could be useful in a broader context.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Excellent job! The actual output aligns perfectly with the retrieval context. Keep up the great work!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input about configuring access control for teams in XWiki. For instance, the first node discusses \"controlling panels and columns,\" which is unrelated. The second node is about \"migrating to Nested Pages,\" which does not pertain to access control. The third node talks about \"changes in space names and API updates,\" which is not relevant. The fourth node explains \"concepts of 'Page' and 'Space',\" which does not aid in configuring access rights. Lastly, the fifth node discusses \"display of configuration options in administration pages,\" which is also irrelevant. All these nodes are ranked higher than any relevant nodes, leading to a score of 0.00.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the steps or details mentioned in the expected output are found in the nodes in the retrieval context."
