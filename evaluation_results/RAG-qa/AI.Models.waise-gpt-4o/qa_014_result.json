    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.84 because the answer provides useful information about disabling notifications, but it includes irrelevant URLs that do not directly address the user's query about managing notifications.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context. Great job!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input query about disabling notifications. For instance, the first node focuses on \"macros and their descriptions,\" the second node discusses \"applications, extensions, and creating custom applications,\" and the third node explains \"extensions and flavors.\" None of these topics address managing or disabling notifications, leading to a low contextual precision score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the sentences in the expected output can be attributed to any nodes in the retrieval context."
