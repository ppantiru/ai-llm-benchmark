  },
  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.94 because the response primarily addresses the process of configuring group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider, which is the core of the query. However, it includes some irrelevant information about LDAP Authenticator and creating new users, which are not directly related to the asked configuration.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on ensuring the actual output aligns perfectly with the retrieval context! Keep up the excellent work!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input query. The first node only lists sections of the OpenID Connect Authenticator documentation without providing specific details on configuring group synchronization. The second node similarly lists sections without actionable steps or details. The third node discusses LDAP group synchronization settings, which are not relevant to the OpenID Connect group synchronization process. The fourth node provides a link to managing users and groups in XWiki but lacks specific information about configuring OpenID Connect group synchronization. Lastly, the fifth node describes general information about the OpenID Connect Authenticator extension, including its developer and rating, but does not provide specific instructions on configuring group synchronization. Therefore, none of the nodes contain relevant information, resulting in a score of 0.00.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.54 because, while the retrieval context aligns with the general topic of configuring group synchronization and includes relevant configuration examples, it lacks specific instructions such as locating and editing the `xwiki.properties` file, replacing placeholders with actual values, and saving the changes and restarting XWiki."
