  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.87 because the actual output provides helpful information, but includes URLs that do not directly address the specific question about restricting uploads to only images or PDF files of a maximum size of 10MB.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, which means the actual output is perfectly aligned with the retrieval context. Great job! Keep up the excellent work!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.70 because while the first node and the fifth node provide relevant steps and information for configuring attachment settings, the second, third, and fourth nodes are ranked higher than they should be. Specifically, the second node mentions mimetype restrictions but lacks the specific steps needed, the third node only provides a default size and a link without detailed steps, and the fourth node discusses mime-types and upload summaries without addressing configuration details. These irrelevant nodes dilute the precision score by being ranked higher than the helpful fifth node.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.75 because while the retrieval context covers most of the detailed steps and configurations needed to set mimetypes and maximum attachment sizes (e.g., nodes 1 and 4), it lacks direct references to the overarching goal of ensuring only images or PDF files of a maximum of 10MB can be uploaded."
