  },
  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.84 because the actual output mostly addresses the question about refusing script rights to a space administrator, but includes irrelevant links to the Administration Application, XWiki RESTful API documentation, and the Authentication guide, which do not directly help with the specific query.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions! Great job maintaining perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Keep up the fantastic work!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all the top-ranked nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input question. For instance, the first node is about \"validation of fields and error messages,\" the second node discusses \"user properties and examples of user lists,\" and the third node covers \"user registration validation.\" None of these nodes address the issue of administrative rights in XWiki, which is the focus of the input question. Therefore, the retrieval system failed to prioritize relevant information, resulting in a contextual precision score of 0.00.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because none of the nodes in the retrieval context mention anything about XWiki not supporting the refusal of rights implied by the admin right."
