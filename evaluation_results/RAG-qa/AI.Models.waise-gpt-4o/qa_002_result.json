  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response directly addresses the issue of not receiving notifications without any irrelevant information. Great job staying focused and on point!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions at all. Keep up the great work!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.25 because the relevant node that mentions the Alert menu and the bell icon, which is crucial for enabling notifications, is ranked fourth. The first three nodes discuss topics such as the Notifications Macro and settings, viewing and marking notifications as read, and live email notifications\u2014none of which are directly relevant to enabling notifications. The high ranking of these irrelevant nodes significantly lowers the score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.67 because although the need to subscribe to pages or users, watching pages, and the process to watch a location are covered in the nodes in the retrieval context, the instructions about enabling notifications in `xwiki.properties` and the 'network' tab in the user profile are not mentioned."
