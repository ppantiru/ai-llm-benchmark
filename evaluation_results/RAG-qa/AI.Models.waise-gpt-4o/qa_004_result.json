    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the question about disabling unwanted notifications. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context! Keep up the excellent work!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.25 because the relevant node that explains how to change notification settings for pages of no interest is ranked fourth, while the top three nodes are irrelevant. For example, the first node discusses clearing notifications and not receiving notifications for actions done by oneself, which doesn't directly address the input query. Similarly, the second node describes general settings but lacks specific instructions on disabling notifications for pages of no interest. The third node talks about system and custom filters without mentioning the required information. This improper ranking of nodes leads to a low contextual precision score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.75 because sentences 1 and 2 in the expected output are supported by nodes 4 and 2 in the retrieval context, respectively, but sentence 4 about deleting existing notification filters in the \"Custom Filters\" list is not mentioned in the retrieval context."
