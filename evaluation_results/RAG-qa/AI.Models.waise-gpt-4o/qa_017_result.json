  },
  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response perfectly addresses the process for setting up group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider that supports group claims. Great job! Keep up the good work!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.92 because the actual output incorrectly mentions configuring group synchronization in the `xwiki.cfg` file using the `oidc.groups.mapping` property, which is not mentioned in the retrieval context.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the relevant nodes are not consistently ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node, which is ranked highest, discusses \"release notes, limitations, and configuration guides for specific systems,\" which is irrelevant to setting up group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider. However, the second node, which is relevant, mentions \"group synchronization\" and \"customization,\" indicating its relevance to the topic. Similarly, the third node discusses \"configuration settings in xwiki.cfg, Active Directory integration, and the OpenID Connect Authenticator Extension,\" which does not provide details on group synchronization and should be ranked lower. The fourth node, which is relevant, explains the \"oidc.groups.mapping property\" and \"custom group synchronization in a listener,\" making it pertinent to the setup process. Therefore, the score reflects that while some relevant nodes are present, they are not consistently prioritized over irrelevant ones.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context does not provide any information related to the setup of group synchronization between XWiki and an OpenID Connect provider, nor does it cover any of the specific instructions or configurations mentioned in the expected output."
