  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.95 because the response is highly relevant and provides clear instructions on configuring OpenID Connect in XWiki. However, it briefly mentions LDAP Authenticator, which is not pertinent to the specific issue of enabling user accounts automatically upon first login.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context! Keep up the excellent work!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node, which includes the crucial information about setting the property `# oidc.enableUser=true` in the `xwiki.properties` file, is ranked first. All irrelevant nodes, such as those discussing the `xwiki.cfg` file, dependencies, LDAP configuration, and various authentication mechanisms, are correctly ranked lower. Great job on achieving perfect contextual precision!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 1.00 because the retrieval context perfectly matches the expected output, providing all necessary details about adjusting the `xwiki.properties` file to enable user accounts on first login. Great job!"
