  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the answer perfectly addresses the question about customizing user profile fields in XWiki using an OpenID Connect provider, with no irrelevant statements present. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context! Keep up the excellent work!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node is ranked first, indicating that it provides the most pertinent information about configuring user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider in XWiki. The subsequent nodes are correctly ranked lower as they discuss unrelated topics such as configuration guides, dependencies, Active Directory, and logging, which do not address the user's specific query. Great job!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.40 because while the retrieval context mentions customizing user profile fields in the `xwiki.properties` file and using the `oidc.user.mapping` property, it lacks specific examples, detailed instructions for replacing placeholders, and the final step of saving and restarting XWiki."
