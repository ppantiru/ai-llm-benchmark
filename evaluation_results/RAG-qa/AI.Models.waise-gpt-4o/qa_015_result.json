  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response directly addresses the specific configuration needed in XWiki for automatic activation of user accounts upon first login with OpenID Connect, without any irrelevant statements. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context! Keep up the excellent work!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all of the nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input question. The first node discusses the configuration example for Univention Corporate Server (UCS) and does not address the automatic activation of user accounts upon first login with OpenID Connect. The second node mentions various configuration guides and limitations but does not provide information on how to automatically activate user accounts. The third node provides general information about the OpenID Connect authenticator and its developer but does not discuss the specific configuration needed. The fourth node refers to various configuration options and endpoints for OpenID Connect but does not mention the specific property needed. The fifth node discusses the installation and configuration of the OpenID Connect authenticator extension but does not provide details on the automatic activation of user accounts upon first login.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.40 because the retrieval context only partially covers the necessary details. While it mentions the `xwiki.properties` file and some configuration aspects related to OpenID Connect, it lacks specific information about uncommenting and setting `oidc.enableUser` to true, restarting the XWiki instance, and ensuring new user accounts are automatically activated on first login."
