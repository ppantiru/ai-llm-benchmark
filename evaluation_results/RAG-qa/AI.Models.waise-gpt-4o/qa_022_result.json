  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.83 because the output includes multiple URL links without context, which do not directly address the issue of not receiving notifications. However, the response still provides some relevant information related to the problem.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context! Keep up the excellent work!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the second node, which is relevant as it \"mentions the alert menu (bell icon) and how to watch locations or users,\" is ranked lower than the first node, which is irrelevant as it \"primarily discusses the Notifications Macro and settings.\" Additionally, several other irrelevant nodes, such as the third node, which \"lists various macros related to notifications but does not provide actionable steps,\" are ranked higher than the relevant context. This misranking of nodes reduces the precision score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.57 because while the retrieval context covers following pages, locations, and users (nodes 2), it does not mention activating notifications via `xwiki.properties` or the 'r\u00e9seau' tab in the user profile."
