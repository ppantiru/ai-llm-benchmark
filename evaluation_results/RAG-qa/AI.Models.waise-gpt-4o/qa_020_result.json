  },
  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.83 because while the answer partially addresses the question about configuring permissions in XWiki, it includes multiple references to a URL that does not directly address the specific query, thereby reducing its overall relevancy.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on ensuring the actual output perfectly aligns with the retrieval context! Keep up the excellent work!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.50 because the relevant node providing \"detailed steps on how to create and manage user groups\" (ranked 2nd) is not ranked higher than irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node only \"provides a link to managing users and groups but does not give specific steps or instructions,\" making it less relevant. Similarly, the 3rd node discusses \"querying groups and access rights\" without specific instructions, and the 4th and 5th nodes talk about \"group synchronization and customization\" and \"RESTful API resources,\" respectively, none of which directly address configuring access and edit rights in XWiki. These irrelevant nodes should be ranked lower to improve the score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.88 because several sentences in the expected output, such as the steps for creating groups and setting wiki-wide and area-specific rights, are well-supported by nodes in the retrieval context, particularly those detailing the administration of users and rights. However, some details, like the inheritance of rights for subpages, are not mentioned in the retrieval context."
