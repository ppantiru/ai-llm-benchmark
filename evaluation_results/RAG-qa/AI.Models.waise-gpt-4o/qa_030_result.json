  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.92 because the response is mostly relevant and helpful for configuring permissions in XWiki, but it includes links to pages about nested pages migration and content organization, which are not directly related to the specific question asked.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on ensuring the actual output perfectly aligns with the retrieval context! Keep up the excellent work!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all the nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. For example, the first node discusses \"the emulation of spaces and pages in XWiki,\" which does not address setting access rights for teams. Similarly, the second node talks about \"changes in XWiki version 16.3.0 and issues with user input and space names,\" which is also unrelated to configuring team-specific access controls. The irrelevant nodes are ranked higher, resulting in a low contextual precision score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context does not provide any information related to the specific steps, actions, or instructions detailed in the expected output for achieving access control in XWiki."
