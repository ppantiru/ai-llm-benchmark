  },
  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.72 because while the answer attempts to address the question about restricting file types and sizes for attachments on a wiki, it repeatedly provides a URL that does not directly answer the specific query. This repetition detracts from the overall relevance, but the effort to provide a resource keeps the score from being lower.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Fantastic job maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context! Keep up the excellent work!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.33 because the relevant node (3rd node) that discusses setting the maximum size of an attachment in the XWikiPreferences document is ranked lower than several irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node discusses configuring properties of documents and attaching files but does not address MIME type restrictions or maximum file size configuration. Similarly, the second node talks about transforming XML documents into various formats using XSLT and FOP, which is unrelated to setting upload restrictions for MIME types or file sizes. These irrelevant nodes being ranked higher than the relevant node significantly lowers the contextual precision score.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.50 because the retrieval context accurately describes the steps for editing XWikiPreferences and changing the Maximum Upload Size, which corresponds to sentences 5-9 in the expected output. However, it does not cover the configuration of MIME types or the specific size limit of 10 MB, which are critical components of the expected instructions."
