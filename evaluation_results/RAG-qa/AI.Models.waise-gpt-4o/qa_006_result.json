  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 1.00 because the response is perfectly relevant and directly addresses the question about customizing user profile fields from an OpenID Connect provider in XWiki. Great job!",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 0.93 because the actual output incorrectly states that additional user profile fields can be mapped by configuring the mappings in the `xwiki.properties` file, whereas the retrieval context does not mention the `xwiki.properties` file at all. Instead, it refers to an association map with a format similar to `oidc.user.nameFormater`.",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 1.00 because the relevant node is correctly ranked first, directly addressing the input question by mentioning \"It's possible to associate non standard properties coming from the OpenID Connect provider with the XWiki user\" and providing examples of \"oidc.user.mapping.\" The irrelevant nodes, such as the second node focusing on \"user profile update events and logging,\" and the third node discussing \"OIDC scope and response types,\" are appropriately ranked lower, ensuring precision in retrieving the most relevant information. Great job!",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.60 because while the retrieval context does provide information on associating non-standard properties from the OpenID Connect provider with XWiki user properties and examples of mapping custom properties (1st node in retrieval context), it lacks specific details on replacing placeholders and the steps to save and restart XWiki to apply changes."
