  },
  "reasons": {
    "AnswerRelevancy": "The score is 0.90 because the response largely addresses the issue with the bell icon not appearing, but includes URLs that are not directly relevant to resolving the specific problem mentioned.",
    "Faithfulness": "The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions. Great job on maintaining perfect alignment with the retrieval context! Keep up the excellent work!",
    "ContextualPrecision": "The score is 0.00 because all the nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node describes \"the visual loading and interaction with notifications\" but does not provide information about enabling notifications. The second node describes \"the notification bell and the types of notifications\" but also fails to mention enabling notifications. The third node lists \"various macros and their functions\" without addressing enabling notifications. The fourth node talks about \"minor events and watching entities\" but not about enabling notifications. Finally, the fifth node mentions \"settings for notifications and the types of notifications users can receive\" but does not explain how to enable notifications. Therefore, the irrelevant nodes are not ranked lower than any relevant nodes, resulting in a contextual precision score of 0.00.",
    "ContextualRecall": "The score is 0.00 because the retrieval context does not mention enabling notifications in the wiki or the `notifications.enabled` setting in `xwiki.properties`. It primarily discusses viewing, managing, and filtering notifications, which does not align with the expected output."
