  "score": 0.8,
  "reason": "The Actual Output addresses the Input prompt by providing a technical adaptation of the text and includes relevant information about the brain's structure and function. However, it diverges from the Expected Output by adding extensive details about neuroimaging techniques and computational models, which, while relevant, are not directly requested. The output is coherent and fluent, with logically connected ideas and smooth readability.",
