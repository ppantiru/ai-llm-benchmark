      "question": "I'm not receiving any notifications.",
      "expected_answer": "Make sure that notifications are enabled. You can enable them by setting the `notifications.enabled` setting in `xwiki.properties` to `true`. Further, ensure that you're subscribed to the pages or users you want to receive notifications for. You can watch a page, a page and its children, or an entire wiki. To watch a location, all you need is to go to that place, and then click on the \"alert\" menu (represented by a bell) and enable the desired notifications. To follow a user, if you go to the profile of an user, using the User Index for example, you can see decide to watching a user. It means you will receive all notifications about events triggered by this user. In your user profile, if you go to the \"network\" tab, you can see the list of users you are watching and the events that have been performed by them."

      "expected_answer": "By default, one don't receive notification about one's own activity (unless the event that triggered the notification targets explicitly that user).

      "question": "I'm receiving lot's of notifications about all kinds of pages I'm not interested in. These seem to have been enabled automatically. How can I disable these notifications?",
      "expected_answer": "By default, a page where you have made a major modification is automatically added to the list of pages you watch. It means you will be notified about changes on your work. You can change the setting for \"Automatic page watching\" in the notification settings in your user profile. You can delete existing notification filters that were created this way in the \"Custom Filters\" list in the notification settings in your user profile."

      "question": "How can I configure XWiki to automatically enable user accounts upon their first login using OpenID Connect?\nI've set up OpenID Connect authentication in my XWiki instance, but users are not automatically enabled after their first login. What configuration do I need to adjust?",
      "expected_answer": "To automatically enable user accounts upon their first login using OpenID Connect in XWiki, you need to adjust the `xwiki.properties` file.\n\nAdd or update the following property:\n\n```\n#-# Define if user accounts should be enabled (marked as active) on first login\n# oidc.enableUser=true\n```\n\nMake sure to uncomment and set the `oidc.enableUser` property to `true`. After making this change, save the file and restart your XWiki instance for the changes to take effect.\n\nThis will ensure that new user accounts are automatically enabled when they log in for the first time via OpenID Connect."

      "question": "Can I customize the user profile fields that are populated from the OpenID Connect provider in XWiki?\nI want to map additional user profile fields from my OpenID Connect provider to XWiki user properties. How can I achieve this?",
      "expected_answer": "Yes, you can customize the user profile fields that are populated from the OpenID Connect provider by mapping them in the `xwiki.properties` file.\n\nTo map additional user profile fields, use the `oidc.user.mapping` property. Here's an example of how to map custom properties:\n\n```\n# oidc.user.mapping=myxproperty1=${oidc.user.subject}\n# oidc.user.mapping=myxproperty2=myprefix-${oidc.user.subject}\n```\n\nReplace `myxproperty1` and `myxproperty2` with the actual XWiki user property names, and `${oidc.user.subject}` with the appropriate variable based on the data provided by your OpenID Connect provider.\n\nAfter configuring the mappings, save the `xwiki.properties` file and restart XWiki to apply the changes."

      "question": "How do I configure group synchronization between XWiki and my OpenID Connect provider?\nI'm using an OpenID Connect provider that supports group claims, and I want to synchronize these groups with XWiki groups. What's the process for setting this up?",
      "expected_answer": "To configure group synchronization between XWiki and your OpenID Connect provider 1. Locate the `xwiki.properties` file in your XWiki installation directory.\n2. Open the file with a text editor.\n3. Configure the group synchronization by setting the `oidc.groups.claim` property to the name of the claim used by your OpenID Connect provider to send group information. For example:\n```java\n#-# The name of the claim used to get the list of groups the user belong to.\n# oidc.groups.claim=groups\n```\nReplace `groups` with the actual claim name provided by your OpenID Connect provider.\n1. If your OpenID Connect provider sends group memberships as a single value attribute delimited by a specific character (e.g., a comma), configure the `oidc.groups.separator` property with the appropriate character:\n```java\n#-# If the identity provider returns group memberships as a single value attribute delimited with a char, for example:\n# oidc.groups.separator=,\n```\nReplace the comma with the actual separator used by your provider.\n1. If you want to map the synchronized groups to specific XWiki groups, configure the `oidc.groups.mapping` property with the appropriate mappings:\n```java\n# oidc.groups.mapping=XWiki.\"MyXWikiGroup\"=group1\n# oidc.groups.mapping=XWiki.\"MyXWikiGroup2\"=group2\n```\nReplace `MyXWikiGroup` and `MyXWikiGroup2` with the names of the XWiki groups you want to map, and `group1` and `group2` with the actual group names provided by your OpenID Connect provider.\n1. Save the `xwiki.properties` file and restart your XWiki instance for the changes to take effect."

      "question": "How can I ensure that only images or PDF files of at maximum 10MB can be uploaded as attachments on the whole wiki?",
      "expected_answer": "To ensure that only images or PDF files of at maximum 10MB can be uploaded as attachments on the whole wiki, follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Configure allowed mimetypes**\n\nEdit the `xwiki.properties` configuration file in your installation and add or update the following line to configure the default mimetype restrictions at farm level:\n```\nattachment.upload.allowList=image/*,application/pdf\n```\nThis will allow only image files (with any subtype, e.g., `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, etc.) and PDF files to be uploaded, and block all other mimetypes.\n\n**Step 2: Configure maximum attachment size**\n\nTo set the maximum attachment size to 10MB, follow these steps:\n\n1. Go to `http://<yourwiki>/xwiki/bin/edit/XWiki/XWikiPreferences?editor=object`\n2. Click on the line that says XWikiPreferences 0 (right below the line that says Objects of type XWiki.XWikiPreferences (1))\n3. Scroll down to the field that says Maximum Upload Size and change the number to `10485760` (10MB in bytes)\n4. Scroll to the bottom and click \"Save\"\n5.

      "question": "We have one space per team. I want all teams to be able to view all spaces but each team should only be able to edit their own space. How can I configure this in XWiki?",
      "expected_answer": "To achieve the desired access control, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Create groups for each team**: Create a separate group for each team in your XWiki instance. This will allow you to manage access rights for each team individually.\n2. **Set wiki-wide rights**: Go to the wiki administration page and set the rights for the entire wiki. Specifically, set the \"View\" right to \"Allow\" for \"XWikiAllGroup\" to allow everyone to view all spaces.\n3. **Set space-level rights**: For each team's space, go to the space administration page and set the rights for that space. Specifically, set the \"Edit\" right to \"Allow\" only for the corresponding team's group. This will allow only the members of that team to edit their own space.\n4. **Inherit rights for child pages**: When setting rights for a space, make sure to select the \"Rights: Page & Children\" option to inherit the rights for all child pages within that space.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll ensure that:\n\n* All teams can view all spaces.\n* Each team can only edit their own space.\n\nRemember to adjust the rights accordingly for any additional teams or spaces you may have in your XWiki instance."
